online-survey-MCDA-package

--------

online-survey-MCDA-package is a 1 month internship
project whose goal was to create an online survey
following the procedure of the MCDA package
and using PhP.

online-survey-MCDA-package is copyrighted by Thomas Baglan (first year student
and intern in the engineering school IMT Atlantique in July 2018)
released under the CeCILL license (v2).

MCDA is an opensource package for the GNU R statistical software, 
implementing functions which can be useful to support
the analyst in the Multicriteria Decision Aiding (MCDA)
process involving multiple, conflicting criteria.

--------

This package is not complete since it does not follow
the complete procedure of the MCDA package (described in
exampleFLOSS.R in the MCDA package).

There was a problem loading the MCDA library using PhP function exec()
which explains why the procedure ends at the "assignments" step.
Apparently PhP was not able to access all R library folders (particularly the
one with the MCDA package) and the problem was not resolved for lack of time.

Some other solutions have been tried : 

	-Using opensource online survey tool such as Limesurvey or phpESP
	-Using the library R-php from Angelo M. Mineo and Alfredo Pontillo

These were however not successful.

For all intents and purposes, online-survey-MCDA-package was implemented on 
a local Apache2 server using PhP 7.2, mySQL, phpmyadmin.
